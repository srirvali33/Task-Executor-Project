# Task-Executor-Project
1.The primary goal of this project is to have implement the multithreaded synchronization needed to implement the TaskExecutor service.
That is, the service maintains a pool of pre-spawned threads that are used to execute Tasks. 
2.The secondary goal of the project is to implement a Finite Bounded FIFO Buffer using only Javaâ€™s Object as Monitors and synchronized blocks.
This is a FIFO queue that is both thread-safe and blocking
